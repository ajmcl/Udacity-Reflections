What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You use git init. It starts the repository so you can record commits and track changes etc.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle point where you can add files to it before you make the commit. The working directory is the log of the previous changes I believe and the reposity is the directory with git enabled if you like.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Add each file you alter to the staging area until they have all had the required changes then do the commit.
